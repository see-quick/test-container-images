# kafka_versions.yaml file stores current supported Kafka versions, which are used in https://github.com/strimzi/test-container/
# repository. Moreover, in the test-container code, we fetch this file during test execution in order to decide what's the
# "latest" version, and what images should be used for a given version. Lastly, one additional information about branches relation:
